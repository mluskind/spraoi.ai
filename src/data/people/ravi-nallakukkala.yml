bio: >
  My interest in mathematics, finance and insurance, coupled with a global
  perspective informed by my International business experience in Japan,
  Switzerland, the UK and the US led me to Spraoi. Since joining the company, I
  have had the opportunity to bring my passions together for the benefit of our
  clients, working on a global team, extending my expertise in insurance and
  developing machine learning solutions.

  At Spraoi, we are building next generation tools and frameworks to automate
  data processing pipelines. Thus enabling developers and data scientists by
  providing a streamlined environment to tackle industry problems in a
  sustainable, repeatable way.
