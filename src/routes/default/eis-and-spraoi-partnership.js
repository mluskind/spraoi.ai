        Integration of Spraoi’s machine learning-enabled portal technology with

      EIS, a core and digital platform provider for insurers, and Spraoi, a
      provider of digital services and consulting, have integrated their
      solutions to provide dental and group and voluntary benefits insurers a
      quicker path to digital transformation of their product development and
      distribution while also optimizing their customer experience.
    </SectionParagraph>
    <br />
    <SectionParagraph>
      As insurers step up the pace of digital transformation to meet market
      expectations, they need to overcome the hurdles of having multiple
      products on separate product platforms and a customer experience that is
      compromised as a result.
    </SectionParagraph>
    <br />
    <SectionParagraph>
      The collaboration between <a href="https://www.eisgroup.com/">EIS</a> and{' '}
      <a href="https://spraoi.ai/">Spraoi</a> is designed to accelerate the
      simplification of systems and the customer experience and quickly enable
      new product offerings, distribution, and AI-assisted customer journeys.
      EIS and Spraoi work as open ecosystem partners. EIS provides a
      comprehensive, industry-leading set of open APIs that expose the quoting,
      rating, policy administration, billing, claims, and customer management
      capabilities within the EIS Suite™ of core applications. Spraoi connects
      to those APIs to build out customer and agent portals within its QuikCover
      solution and delivers machine learning models to improve operating
      outcomes from quote to claim.
    </SectionParagraph>
    <br />
    <SectionParagraph>
      The integration has already been deployed by{' '}
      <a href="https://renaissancefamily.com/">Renaissance</a>, a nationwide
      provider of dental, vision, life, disability and accident products to
      support a diverse product portfolio and deliver a next-gen distribution
      and customer experience.
    </SectionParagraph>
    <br />
    <SectionParagraph>
      “Through our ongoing partnership with Spraoi, we are taking another step
      toward helping insurers become the agile and customer-centered
      organizations that the future of insurance demands of them,” said Tony
      Grosso, head of marketing at EIS. “EIS is executing an open ecosystem
      strategy that leverages the native openness of our platform to connect
      quickly with complementary solutions and compound the business value of
      carriers’ digital transformations. Insurers can benefit immensely from
      technology partners that are aligned technically and culturally when
      building platforms that are responsive to the market.”
    </SectionParagraph>
    <br />
    <SectionParagraph>
      In addition to its portal technology, Spraoi’s machine learning models can
      also positively influence many core processes enabled through the EIS®
      platform. For example, to improve propensity to buy, as consumers engage
      with the platform, the solution can deliver recommendations on what
      products are most relevant to them through EIS Suite to the end consumer,
      based on their persona. In the claims process, Spraoi delivers machine
      learning models through to the adjusters and various stakeholders for
      segmentation, assignment, auto adjudication, and fraud detection. The
      integration of EIS and Spraoi solution is available to the
      property/casualty and group/voluntary benefits spaces.
    </SectionParagraph>
    <br />
    <SectionParagraph>
      “Spraoi is excited by our progressive partnership with EIS because we
      share a vision of how new generation technologies should be delivered to
      carriers,” says Karan Mishra, co-founder, Spraoi. “We have a natural fit.
      Spraoi solutions take maximum advantage of EIS’ fully digital core to
      provide an enhanced and adaptive user experience. This means insurers get
      maximum value from their digital transformation investment.”
